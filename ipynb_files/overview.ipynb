Our empirical results suggest that our martingale-based anomaly detection algorithm successfully identifies concept changes (anomalies) in streaming data for each method.\n",

Regarding power martingales, it would have been useful to make our algorithm match exactly that of Vovk's research on USPS data. Furthermore, as seen in the plots on our conclusion page, we may have been able to improve the performance so that it yielded better results than the simple derivative-based algorithm. Regarding adiabatic iterative SVM methods, we were not able to fully implement the algorithm. \n",

We used the nearest-neighbor and SVM methods, but additional strangeness measures could have been utilized.
